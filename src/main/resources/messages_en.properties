index.information=In order to get more information about peptide and how they operate in the 3D space, this application was made. It reads PDB files and analyses and visualizes oligopeptides with the given length!
index.project.txt=\nThe majority of the biological machinery is made up of proteins, which are just lengthy chains of connected amino acids. Although this relationship is exceedingly difficult to assess, in theory, the structure, dynamics, and function of such proteins follow from the individual building pieces.\n\n\n\nMapping the peptidome consists of two parts: First there are the sequences to be mapped with metadata about occurrences as native oligopeptides and with experimental data. Second, there are the configurational properties; the three- dimensional shapes the oligopeptide can adopt, the corresponding secondary structure annotations and the conformational flexibility (how and how much does it move).\n\n\n\nThe latter aspect was difficult to characterize, because 1. for flexible molecules analysis of the data space and data reduction by means of PCA is very hard to apply and 2. the data are hard to cluster because of the amount and the complexity. A solution to the latter problem was recently developed that consists in essence of a combination of multidimensional scaling and multilinear regression to obtain a mapping between the actual configurations and a low-dimensional abstract data space.
