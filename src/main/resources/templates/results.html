          <p class="subtitle">Relatively little is known about the broader scope of such peptides, which may be dubbed the 'peptidome'. Mapping the peptidome consists of two parts: First there are the sequences to be mapped with metadata about occurrences as native oligopeptides, as part of proteins, and with experimental data. Second, there are the configurational properties; the three- dimensional shapes the oligopeptide can adopt, the corresponding secondary structure annotations and the conformational flexibility (how and how much does it move). The latter aspect was difficult to characterize, because 1. for flexible molecules analysis of the data space and data reduction by means of PCA is very hard to apply and 2. the data are hard to cluster because of the amount and the complexity. A solution to the latter problem was recently developed that consists in essence of a combination of multidimensional scaling and multilinear regression to obtain a mapping between the actual configurations and a low-dimensional abstract data space.</p>
